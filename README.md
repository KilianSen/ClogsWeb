# Clogs Web - A Clogs Web Interface

Clogs Web is a web interface for managing and interacting with Clogs, a popular open-source container health and monitoring tool.

This web interface allows for a mixture of statuspage by atlassian and portainer,
while providing no risk to your containers.

## Deployment
See Clogs Deployment Documentation for more information on deploying Clogs Web.

__Note:__ Clogs Web is deployable as a standalone container or can be integrated into an existing Clogs deployment.
Still we recommend deploying Clogs Web as part of Clogs Server for the best experience.
